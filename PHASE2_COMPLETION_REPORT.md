## CLI Validation Results

All tasks have been successfully tested via the CLI interface:

```bash
# Examples of working commands:
python -c "from sentinelx.cli import app; app()" run disk-forensics --params '{"image": "evidence.img", "type": "timeline"}'
python -c "from sentinelx.cli import app; app()" run chain-ir --params '{"address": "0x123", "type": "trace"}'
python -c "from sentinelx.cli import app; app()" run c2 --params '{"mode": "test", "port": 8080}'
python -c "from sentinelx.cli import app; app()" run social-eng --params '{"campaign_type": "phishing"}'
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Task Registration**: 18/18 tasks successfully registered
- **Import Success**: 100% of modules import without errors  
- **Execution Success**: All tested tasks produce valid output
