- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security reviews, dependency scanning

### Project Risks  
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined phases, defer non-essential features
- **Tool Compatibility**: Test integrations early, have fallback options
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize high-value features, consider phased delivery

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**:
   - Set up Python packaging with pyproject.toml
   - Implement basic task registration system
   - Create simple integration tests

2. **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**:
   - Complete Phase 1 foundation work
   - Begin SlitherScan and AutoPwn implementations
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

3. **Medium Term (Month 2-3)**:
   - Complete Phase 2 security tool integrations
   - Establish testing and documentation practices
   - Begin Phase 3 advanced features

The SentinelX framework has excellent architectural foundations and with focused development effort can become a powerful unified security testing platform. The modular design will allow for incremental development and testing of each component.
