# Development Directory

This directory contains development files, reports, and testing artifacts that are useful for ongoing development but not part of the core project distribution.

## Structure

### `reports/`
Development reports and status documents:
- Phase completion reports
- Project status reviews
- Implementation summaries
- Critical issue documentation

### `validation/`
Testing and validation scripts:
- Task validation scripts
- Test results and outputs
- Debugging tools
- Performance testing

### `test-files/`
Test data and development files:
- Sample vulnerable code files
- Test contracts and configurations
- Development workflows
- Quick testing scripts

## Usage

These files are kept in the repository for:
- Development history and documentation
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Performance analysis
- Cross-environment development (Codespaces, local, etc.)

## Note

Files in this directory are not required for production deployment but provide valuable context for development and maintenance.
